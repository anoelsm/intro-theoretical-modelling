# Introduction to theoretical modelling of phytoplankton communities in R

<p>In 2021, I was asked to do a guest lecture on modelling in R. I created a presentation and a lab exercise from scratch. If you are interested, the following walk through explains how to develop a theoretical model. This is the basis of some of my modeling work such as that seen in <a href="https://anoelsm.github.io/media/Smith&Edwards_2019-Oikos.pdf">Smith and Edwards (2019). Oikos.</a></p>

<p>Materials used in a guest lecture on theroetical modelling of phytoplankton communities in R. See: <a href="https://anoelsm.github.io/modelling_phytoplankton_communities.html">here</a> for full description and walk-through.</p>
